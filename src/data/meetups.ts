      'In a collection of essays, Malcolm Gladwell explores the relationship between power and prestige on the one hand and weakness and struggle on the other. Two theses run through the essays in David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants. The first thesis is that in a contest where one side is obviously superior to the other by conventional standards, the weaker side often has one or more underappreciated advantages. The second thesis is that too much strength can be a bad thingâ€”a phenomenon represented graphically by an inverted-U curve: as strength increases along the horizontal axis, the benefit, on the vertical axis, at first rises but eventually begins to fall.',
